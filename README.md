## Dellaflix
I decided to develop a project inspired by Netflix when I faced the dilemma of every programmer who is building his portoflio, which project would be fun to work on?
Dellaflix came up as the answer, since I would challenge myself both on the backend by developing a movie API, and if the movie searched doesn't exist in my database, look it up in another API (The Movie Database) and on the frontend by cloning Netflix's design.
